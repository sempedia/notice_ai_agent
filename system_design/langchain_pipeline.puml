User -> (info_parse_prompt) : Provides raw email
note bottom of (info_parse_prompt)
    The User represents the sender
    of the raw email message, typically
    a regulatory notice from a
    government or another organization.
end note

(info_parse_prompt) -> (notice_parser_model) : Structured query
note bottom of (info_parse_prompt)
    info_parse_prompt is a template
    that instructs the LLM on how
    to parse the raw email, extracting
    fields such as entity name,
    violation type, and compliance deadlines.
end note

(notice_parser_model) -> (NoticeEmailExtract) : Structured output
note bottom of (notice_parser_model)
    The output from info_parse_prompt
    is passed to the notice_parser_model,
    a GPT model that processes the structured
    query and extracts the required data
    (e.g., entity name, project ID, violation).
end note

note bottom of (NoticeEmailExtract)
    The model's output is converted into
    a structured format based on the schema
    defined in the NoticeEmailExtract class.
    This structured data contains the fields
    extracted from the raw email message.
end note

note bottom of (NoticeEmailExtract)
    The final structured output includes
    fields such as entity_name, date_of_notice,
    project_id, violation_type, compliance_deadline,
    and more. These are ready for use in the system
    (e.g., triggering notifications or storing
    in the database).
